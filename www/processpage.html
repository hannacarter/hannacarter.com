        <h3>Gradient Mesh Project</h3>
        <p>
        The main objective of the first project in ARTGR 275 was to create a photorealistic image using Adobe Illustrator. We were asked to used mainly the pen tool, the gradient mesh tool, and the eye-dropper tool. Through this project it was expected that we would develop a number of targeted skills, including pen tool, gradient, transparency, group, ungroup, lock, unlock, and many more. We were asked to do choose an object, which we then sketched and photographed before placing it in Illustrator to go on creating a photorealistic image.</p>

     <h3>Invitation Plate Project</h3>
     <p>
       For this project, we were asked to create or find text for a how-to, invitation, or recipe. I chose to make an invitation, taking the text from the 1998 Wes Anderson film, "Rushmore." We were asked to create 12 final plates--two with experimentation in proximity, another two with size, weight, weight and size, color, and visual punctuation. These all built off of each other, so by the final two plates I was able to use proximity, weight, size, color, and visual punctuation. Here I have shown my best ten plates. </br>
I took a lot of inspiration in this project from Wes Anderson. The colors that I used reflected off of a number of his films such as "The Life Aquatic" and "Fantastic Mr. Fox."</p>

   		<h3>Crayon Mock-Up Advertisements</h3>
   	 	<p>This project was based off my final project for my digital photography course I took during the fall 2013 sememester. Taking the images I used in that project (which were used to create eight visual narrative pieces that incorporated the concepts "joy", "vast", and "crayons"), I made a few different advertisements for crayons.</p>

        <h3>Meredith Editorial Project</h3>
        <p>
        The main objective of the third project in ARTGR 275 was to create a cover, table of contents, and three editorial feature spreads in InDesign. We were asked to research and develop a target audience, sketch our own and trace found layouts and grid systems, and develop an underlying design system for our project. Throughout this project, it was excepted that we word learn a number of skills such as using document and preference settings; working with types, tabs, and color; and printing.
